<B><U>SHIMLA:</B></U> The Army rescued four people, including one injured, after flash floods hit parts of Himachal Pradesh, an official statement issued on Thursday said.

<sub>The flash floods triggered by a cloudburst</sub> hit the higher reaches of <sup>Rishi Dogri valley in Kinnaur district</sup> on Wednesday evening, and the bridge across the Sutlej river was inundated.

<p> The site was an active road construction zone under CPWD towards Gangthang Bralam, the Army said.

<blockquote><Q>On receiving an urgent request from the superintendent of police, <i>Kinnaur</i>, the Army immediately mobilised a Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) column.
Braving darkness, fast currents, and unstable terrain, the team reached the location and discovered four civilians stranded on the far bank of the river, the statement said.</q></blockquote>

Working with precision under challenging conditions, the HADR team illuminated the general area to facilitate night rescue operations and guided stranded civilians to higher and safer locations.
